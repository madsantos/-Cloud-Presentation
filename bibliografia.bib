@article{Anglano2008,
abstract = {Desktop grids are being increasingly used as the execution platform for a variety of applications that can be structured as bag-of-tasks (BoT). Scheduling BoT applications on desktop grids has thus attracted the attention of the scientific community, and various schedulers tailored towards them have been proposed in the literature. However, previous work has focused on scheduling a single BoT application at a time, thus neglecting other scenarios in which several users submit multiple BoT applications at the same time. This paper aims at filling this gap by proposing a set of scheduling algorithms able to deal with multiple BoT applications. The performance of these algorithm has been evaluated, by means of simulation, for a large set of operational scenarios obtained by varying both the workload submitted to the desktop grid and the characteristics of the involved resources. Our results show that, although there is no a clear winner among the proposed solutions, knowledge-free strategies (that is, strategies that do not require any information concerning the applications or the resources) can provide good performance.},

@article{Beaumont2008,
abstract = {Multiple applications that execute concurrently on heterogeneous platforms compete for CPU and network resources. In this paper, we consider the problem of scheduling applications to ensure fair and efficient execution on a distributed network of processors. We limit our study to the case where communication is restricted to a tree embedded in the network, and the applications consist of a large number of independent tasks (Bags of Tasks) that originate at the tree's root. The tasks of a given application all have the same computation and communication requirements, but these requirements can vary for different applications. The goal of scheduling is to maximize the throughput of each application while ensuring a fair sharing of resources between applications. We can find the optimal asymptotic rates by solving a linear programming problem that expresses all necessary problem constraints, and we show how to construct a periodic schedule from any linear program solution. For single-level trees, the solution is characterized by processing tasks with larger communication-to-computation ratios at children with larger bandwidths. For multilevel trees, this approach requires global knowledge of all application and platform parameters. For large-scale platforms, such global coordination by a centralized scheduler may be unrealistic. Thus, we also investigate decentralized schedulers that use only local information at each participating resource. We assess their performance via simulation and compare to an optimal centralized solution obtained via linear programming. The best of our decentralized heuristics achieves the same performance on about 2/3 of our test cases but is far worse in a few cases. Although our results are based on simple assumptions and do not explore all parameters (such as the maximum number of tasks that can be held on a node), they provide insight into the important question of fairly and optimally scheduling heterogeneous applications on heterogeneo-

@article{Benoit2010,
abstract = {Scheduling problems are already difficult on traditional parallel machines, and they become extremely challenging on heterogeneous clusters. In this paper, we deal with the problem of scheduling multiple applications, made of collections of independent and identical tasks, on a heterogeneous master-worker platform. The applications are submitted online, which means that there is no a priori (static) knowledge of the workload distribution at the beginning of the execution. The objective is to minimize the maximum stretch, i.e., the maximum ratio between the actual time an application has spent in the system and the time this application would have spent if executed alone. On the theoretical side, we design an optimal algorithm for the offline version of the problem (when all release dates and application characteristics are known beforehand). We also introduce a heuristic for the general case of online applications. On the practical side, we have conducted extensive simulations and MPI experiments, showing that we are able to deal with very large problem instances in a few seconds. Also, the solution that we compute totally outperforms classical heuristics from the literature, thereby fully assessing the usefulness of our approach.},

@article{Oliveira2012,
abstract = {Cloud computing infrastructures are the most recent approach to the development and conception of computational systems. Cloud infrastructures are complex environments with various subsystems, each one with their own challenges. Cloud systems should be able to provide the following fundamental property: elasticity. Elasticity is the ability to automatically add and remove instances according to the needs of the system. This is a requirement for pay-per-use billing models. Various open source software solutions allow companies and institutions to build their own Cloud infrastructure. However, in most of these, the elasticity feature is quite immature. Monitoring and timely adapting the active resources of a Cloud computing infrastructure is key to provide the elasticity required by diverse, multi-tenant and pay-per-use business models. In this paper, we propose Elastack, an automated moni- toring and adaptive system, generic enough to be applied to existing IaaS frameworks, and intended to enable the elas- ticity they currently lack. Our approach offers any Cloud in- frastructure the mechanisms to implement automated mon- itoring and adaptation as well as the flexibility to go be- yond these. We evaluate Elastack by integrating it with the OpenStack showing how easy it is to add these important features with a minimum, almost imperceptible, amount of modifications to the default installation.},

@article{Oprescu2010,
abstract = {Commercial cloud offerings, such as Amazon\&\#x02019;s EC2, let users allocate compute resources on demand, charging based on reserved time intervals. While this gives great¿exibility to elastic applications, users lack guidance for choosing between multiple offerings, in order to complete their computations within given budget constraints. In this work, we present BaTS, our budget-constrained scheduler. BaTS can schedule large bags of tasks onto multiple clouds with different CPU performance and cost, minimizing completion time while respecting an upper bound for the budget to be spent. BaTS requires no a-priori information about task completion times, and learns to estimate them at runtime. We evaluate BaTS by emulating different cloud environments on the DAS-3 multi-cluster system. Our results show that BaTS is able to schedule within a user-definedbudget (if such a schedule is possible at all.) At the expense of extra compute time, significant cost savings can be achieved when comparing to a cost-oblivious round-robin scheduler.},

abstract = {We present a holistic approach for efficient execution of bags-of-tasks (BOTs) on multiple grids, clusters, and volunteer computing grids virtualized as a single computing platform. The challenge is twofold: to assemble this compound environment and to employ it for execution of a mixture of throughput- and performance-oriented BOTs, with a dozen to millions of tasks each. Our generic mechanism allows per BOT specification of dynamic arbitrary scheduling and replication policies as a function of the system state, BOT execution state, and BOT priority. We implement our mechanism in the GridBot system and demonstrate its capabilities in a production setup. GridBot has executed hundreds of BOTs with over 9 million jobs during three months alone; these have been invoked on 25,000 hosts, 15,000 from the Superlink@Technion community grid and the rest from the Technion campus grid, local clusters, the Open Science Grid, EGEE, and the UW Madison pool.},
